<h1>Old rugged cross</h1>
<h5>Song by Charles Wesley</h5>
<hr>

<pre>On a hill far away stood an old rugged
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

     CHORUS
     So I'll cherish the old rugged   
     Till my trophy at last i lay down  
     I'll clige to the old rugged cross  
     And exchange is some for a crown.
     <pre>
